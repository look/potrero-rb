<h2>Welcome to Potrero.rb</h2>
<p>
Potrero.rb is a <strong>Ruby Brigade</strong> on the model of <a href="http://www.seattlerb.org/">Seattle.rb</a>. We organize a <strong>weekly hack night</strong> where you can hack on your own project or help others with theirs. Unlike other meetup groups in town, we do not organize talks. Check out <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SFRails/">SFRails</a> or <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/">SFRuby</a> for that.
</p>

<p>
To attend Potrero.rb, bring a project to work on (it's a great chance to do some open source hacking). With everyone working on a project, every Potrero.rb meeting is a success no matter how many people show up. <strong>All are welcome,</strong> even if you have the misfortune of not living or working in Potrero Hill.
</p>

    <p>Bring a project to work on. Work on whatever you like, but here are some ideas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>An open source library (check out Seattle.rb's <a href="http://www.seattlerb.org/projects">impressive list</a>).</li>
      <li>An article you've been meaning to work on.</li>
      <li>Homework for your MOOC.</li>
      <li>The Potrero.rb website.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>This group is inspired by <a href="http://www.justin.tv/confreaks/c/2250301">Miles Forrest's RailsConf 2013 lightning talk on cloning the Seattle Ruby brigade</a>. As related by Miles, the three secrets to Seattle.rb's success are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Forget presentations. Do hack nights.</li>
  <li>Bring a project.</li>
  <li>Meet every week.</li>
</ol>

<p>Potrero.rb exists to give Rubyists in the Potrero area a place to meet each other and get stuff done.</p>
